# vagrant-dummy-mail
Vagrantfile that creates a VM that redirects all mail sent within it to the mailbox of a dummy user inside this VM. 

It provides IMAP&amp;SMTP servers to allow accessing that dummy users email.

This is proof of concept design to improve the development of email sending applications inside of virtual machines.
